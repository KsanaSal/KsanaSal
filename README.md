### Hi, I'm Oksana Salivon ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate Front-end developer with a desire to learn and grow in a collaborative team environment. After working for 20 years in the Antonov company as a 3D engineer designer and had achieved maximum development in this field, I decided to completely change my field of activity. I am looking for an entry-level position with a company to use my skills in coding, troubleshooting complex problems, and assisting in the timely completion of projects.I skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Angular, I know English at an intermediate level and am learning it now to improve my level. Development, practice and work for the result are important for me.
